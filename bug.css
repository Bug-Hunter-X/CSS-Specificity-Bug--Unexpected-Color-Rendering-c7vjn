The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order.  The unexpected outcome arises from the interplay between the `id` selector and the class selector, along with the order in which styles are defined within the stylesheet:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green;
}

```

When applied to an element with both the `id` 'myElement' and the class 'myClass', one might expect the color to be green because of the higher specificity of `#myElement.myClass`. However, the final rendered color might still be blue or red depending on the order the CSS is parsed, or additional factors not explicitly in the code. This is because CSS specificity and cascade rules create complex and sometimes unintuitive behavior.

This is difficult to debug because the bug is not immediately apparent from the CSS itself; it requires understanding the way the browser processes and applies the CSS rules.

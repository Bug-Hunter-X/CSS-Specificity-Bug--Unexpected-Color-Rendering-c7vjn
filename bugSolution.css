The solution involves understanding that the order of declaration in CSS is also crucial. While the selector `#myElement.myClass` has the highest specificity, the order might lead to unexpected results. A more predictable and reliable approach is to explicitly define the styles in a way that avoids conflicts and ambiguity:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green !important; /*Ensures the desired style is applied*/
}
```

By using `!important`, we ensure that the `green` color is always applied for elements matching both the id and the class, regardless of other CSS declarations or order issues.  While using `!important` should be done judiciously, in this case, it is a solution to explicitly enforce the desired style.  Alternatively, a more thorough restructuring of the CSS or more precise selectors may remove the need for `!important`.
